#### What does your project do? ####

This application is built for my customer demonstrations of an open source platform called Tility.
It provides the user with a customizable UI (customizable in that it can be adjusted to suit the customer - include their logo etc) so they can show in a individualized way how Tility solution would work and provide value for them.

### What is Tility? ###

Tility is a 'token' (XTL) and DaPP that allows Utility providers and their customers in different sectors to trade value.
eg. 
As a: solar micro-grid user
I can: use the surplus solar energy I produce as currency
to: purchase mobile minutes from my telco.

example:
Say you are a customer of SOLAR.org and you have your own solar 'unit' powering your home.
You are also a customer of MOBILE.org who provide you with a monthly supply of mobile phone minutes.
As a customer of SOLAR.org you routinely produce more power than you consume,
whereas with your MOBILE.org contract you routinely consume more than you produce.

The Tility token and platform enables you to use the value from the surplus power you produce to directly purchase extra MOBILE.org minutes you need.

### How does it work? ###
The platform (SOLAR.org unit) monitors how many units of Energy (kWh) you as a user are sending back into the grid.
Under this system that value is mapped (through an exchange rate) and represented as a quantity of Tility Tokens (XTL).
For example 1kWh = 5100 XTL.
Similarly, mobile minutes are also mapped into the same Tility denomination - i.e. 1Mobile Minute = 22,000 XTL.

As a customer of a Tility participating company I can see my own XTL balance as well as a list of the participating companies and how much of their services I can purchase with my XTL balance.

In the case of our example I can use the Spend XTL function to purchase the Mobile minutes I need.
In this way I can use the value I create in one service to directly offset value I consume in another.

This results in a more efficient use of social and environmental resources.
It also provides an eco-system through which good social and environmental behaviour can be incentivized (i.e. a government or provider may wish to promote use of solar so will subsidize that category for it's community providing more XTL/kWh).

### Functions available ###
The demo UI here provides several functions required to tell the story to potential customers.

# 1 - The ability to enroll/register as a User.
here you can register your details and upload a company logo and user avatar pic.  For example if you are selling the solution to customer John Doh - Company SOLAR.org.
upon registering the page will include the company logo, user picture, XTL balance etc.. the idea is that this would be a profile page on that clients website.

# 2 - The ability to enroll/register a participating company.
this section allows you to provide a custom listing of participating companies, including their logo and details.. here you would register MOBILE.org and you can register total of 4.
upon registering the participating company is listed with their category and the user can see on the table how much of their services are available for them to purchase.

# 3 - Voting and Exchange Rates
at the very top of the page there is an 'Exchange Rate' section.  this shows the real time purchasing power of XTL (eg 5100XTL buys 1kWh power).
The value shown here is derived from two variables.

a) One is the Exchange rates manually entered at the very bottom of the page for each category (defaults are provided initially if these are not entered).

b) The second is based on how many 'Votes' each category has had in the 'Voting table'.
The voting function gives the user an option to 'encourage' adoption/uptake of a category by 'donating' XTL to subsidize its cost.
For example if I hit the 'vote solar' button I will send 5,000 XTL from my balance to this category.  This contribution is then factored into the exchange rate for the category - increasing the XTL-Category value.
Therefore if the Solar category has a large amount of community 'voting' contributions the amount of XTL I get for my 1kWh is more.. in turn meaning I will have a higher XTL balance and can purchase more mobile minutes.
The voting function here is primarily used to show the ability of participants in this system to motivate good behaviour.
In a real life example Government X may wish to particate in the scheme and donate 100,000 XTL to Water to promote water saving behaviour for their community.
